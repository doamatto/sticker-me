# Sticker Me!

Sticker Me is a simple way to rip stickers from Line. Please do not steal the hard work of other artists and companies and do not use ripped stickers for commercial gains or voiding any of Line's terms of service.

This is a simple experiment to experiment a bit further with Node.js.
